## Problem

### On Demand Talent Matching

How can you allow brands and creators to match based on mutual preferences for roles' required skills, interests, values, and experience?

### Inclusive Hiring and Recruitment

How can you create an equitable solution to speed up the recruiting and hiring process of freelancers by brands?

## Overview

Company culture is vital. But ineffable.

Both employees and employes want to find a culture match. But if you can't describe it, only feel it, how can you match? Culture is often based on vibes, and how well people vibe with each other.

It's our opinion that finding actual answers are impossible. Any real comparisons you can make between employees at a company are, at best, going to find similarities, which is often the exact opposite of what a successful or innovative individual or department wants.

So how to find value in an ineffable questions? Ineffable answers.

## Solution

Everything you see on the screen is designed to be a double-blind. Does the timer matter or does your decision to find 30 words or 4 numbers? Do you change your decisions often, unable to find the right electronic music to help you shuffle together a flower, or are you confident that this cat is green and pink striped?

We don't know the answers to the questions we ask. But we think data matters. We think we'll see relationships between different clusters of people. We think we'll see trends. What does it mean? We don't know. But people find meaning in everything.

Listen, we're fully aware that knowing without a doubt what a wutox looks like could mean nothing. But what if it does mean something? What if you make it mean something? What if your irritation at someone who can't recognize an adably means something?

People make connections. We want to help.
